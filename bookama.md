## The context

this is a simple app i used to learn  javascript and the DOM on the net ninja channel by schaun. I really appreciate how the tutorial was structure and it really help me improving my skills on the DOM manipulations. Even tho my app is not completly working like his i've try my best to learn more on the DOM.
